Game engine:
- 3d block-based world
  - play mostly in one plane
  - depth broken into parallax layers in predetermined places
  - multi-tile entities
  - variable-sized rooms w/ neighbors a la D4
- compressed JSON for storage
  - world stored as a hash tre
    - indirect references (using UUIDs and sequential IDs)
      between most objects
    - tree maps as dictionaries f
- BUILD A NICE 2.5D TILE EDITOR
  - block references 'visual representation'
  - visual representation indicates shape ID and material map ID
  - shape indicates heightfield and material map indexes for each pixel
    - 4 'stain' variations on each material for minor color variation
  - edit one sprite sheet at a time, export to blocks
  - no need to pre-bake transformations
  - allow editing milti-tile images to define related tiles such as pipes
- auto-generated data classes (if any), [de]serialization routines
  - NO BEHAVIOR defined by data classes!
