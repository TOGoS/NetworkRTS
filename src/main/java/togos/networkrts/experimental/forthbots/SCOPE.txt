Forth bots

Robots in a simple tile-based world run Forth programs.

Scope:
- Simple tile based world - toroidal 256x256 grid with a single layer of tiles
- Mutable objects to represent world
- Simple Forth-like bytecode interpreter
- Simple tile display system (colors and simple hardcoded patterns)
- World loaded from a text file
- Bot programs can listen for radio messages and act on them e.g. by replacing their program

NOT in scope:
- Large worlds
- Complex worlds
- Client-server networking
- Visibility calculations
- Fancy graphics

Next phase:
- Use IP networking to control bots
