Framework for a Node.js-like event loop.

ProgramRunner implements the event loop.

A ProgramSegment is a series of non-blocking instructions.

ProgramSegments can schedule other program segments for immediate
execution after their run() method returns.  This allow
continuation-passing-style function calls and returns.

ProgramSegments can also schedule other program segments to be run
at a specific time in the future or when data is available from an
external source (these external sources are implementations of Pusher).
In either case, the scheduled program segment will run in the main
interpreter thread.

It would be cumbersome to implement a program out of ProgramSegments
directly in Java.  The idea is to compile them from another language,
possibly a Java-like language with functions added.
