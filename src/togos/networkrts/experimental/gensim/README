Model for simulation with variable-length step intervals.

There are a couple of obvious and subtly different approaches.



== Event Loop A ==

In this model, all events (scheduled and realtime) go through a TimedEventQueue.

|_____________|        |___________________|



== Event Loop B ==

In this model, immediate events and known future events (i.e. timers)
do not need to go through the TimedEventQueue.  The simulation tells
the event loop when it needs to be updated even if no event occurs.

This has the advantages over A:
- It is more straightforward to write the simulation in a purely functional
  way, since it does not need to modify an external queue.
- Though queues may be used inside the simulation, they do not need to be
  thread safe.

Design is similar to the that of the main loop in 'automatic.d' or whatever the I renamed that to most recently.

The main loop pulls events and the current time from a real time event
source and passes increments of time and events on to the simulation.
It will wait for an event from the event source until the next automatic
update by the simulation occurs.

The simulation probably contains a timer queue and a world.

World objects can react to events by putting new events in the timer queue,
modifying the world immediately, or sending messages to external actors.

External actors are simulated outside the simulation and can only make
modifications to it by passing events back through the real-time event source.
