A physical object has a location, which may be:
- in a component slot of another object
- inside a 'bag' (which may be modeled as a large component slot?)
- some (x,y,z) position within a room

Objects can only be linked (via ports) to other objects within the same space.

A group of connected objects may be moved as long as they are only
connected to each other.  An object may not be moved while it is
connected to objects not being moved.

Other than to their containing spaces, objects are linked only by connectors.    

All objects, even rooms, are contained in some space except for the root
object space, which acts like a bag.
