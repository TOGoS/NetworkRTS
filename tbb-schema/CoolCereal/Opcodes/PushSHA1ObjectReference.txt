Push SHA1 object reference onto the stack.

This opcode is followed by the 20-byte SHA-1 sum of a byte string
which describes an object to be pushed onto the stack.

The method by which the object is described/serialized is not specified. 

This does not require that the object or its serialized form actually
be loaded into memory.
Implementations are free to push only a reference to the object and
dereference it lazily, so long as their appearance in the stack is
functionally equivalent to that of the referenced object.
