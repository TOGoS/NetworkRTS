Create NetworkRTS World Object

Following the opcode is a base128-encoded (unsigned) integer defining
which constructor (actually an arbitrary function as far as this
specification is concerned) is to be invoked.

The functions may themselves read more bytes from the instruction stream.

The constructor number -> function mapping is not defined here.
Presumably all implementations will agree by convention on the meaning
of a particular constructor ID.  Once defined, constructor IDs should
retain their meaning forever.

If a constructor ID is encountered whose mapping is unknown to the
interpreter, it should be treated as malformed input, and evaluation
must stop.
