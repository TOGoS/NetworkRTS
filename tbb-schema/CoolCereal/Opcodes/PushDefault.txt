Push a value representing 'default' onto the stack.

The interpretation of this value is left to operations that take it as input.
It is intended as a compact way to indicate that the default value should
be used.

It's expected that in most cases, said default value will represent
an empty collection or indicate a lack of knowledge or applicability.
