Load opcode named by 20-byte string.

This opcode loads a single opcode, named by a 20-byte string, into the opcode table.

It is followed by 21 bytes:
The first byte is indicates the destination slot in the opcode table.
The 20 bytes following that name the opcode to be loaded.

Normally those 20 bytes should be the SHA-1 sum of a file (such as this one)
that describes the intended behavior of the opcode.
