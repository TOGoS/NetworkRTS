Push SHA1 blob reference onto the stack.

This opcode is followed by the 20-byte SHA-1 sum of a byte string
which is to be pushed onto the stack.

This does not require that the blob actually be loaded into memory.
Implementations are free to push only a reference to the data and
dereference it lazily, so long as their appearance in the stack is
functionally equivalent to that of the referenced data.
