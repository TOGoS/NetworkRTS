		CoolCereal serialization format, based on TBB\x81.
		Additional documentation may be available at
		http://www.nuke24.net/docs/2014/CoolCereal.html
		
		The referenced TBB schema document may be:
		- This RDF document, which gives an empty stack and a single
		  'load opcode library' opcode, or
		- Another CoolCereal blob, which will be interpreted to initialize
		  the opcode library and stack.  i.e. a preamble.  This serves as
		  a compression scheme and has the exact same effect as including
		  the referenced blob inline would.
		
		The payload (after the TBB header) format is a bytecode stream.
		
		The only predefined opcode, 0x01, reads the following 20 bytes
		from the bytecode stream, interprets it as the name of an opcode
		library, and registers the opcodes.  Interpretation of the name
		is not specified.  It may reference a text file describing the
		opcodes, or some machine-readable format.
		
		Opcodes defined later take precedence over earlier-defined ones.
		
		The value left on top of the stack after the entire instruction
		stream has been interpreted is the serialized value.
