Cave explorers
 - Can build cave exploration buildings on top of cave entrances
 - Remote controlled cave explorer

Resource usage
 - 'Computers' use lots of energy, networking equipment takes a small amount
 - Physical objects (workers, ammunition) is treated as pullable resources
 - Must create ammo factories next to guns
 - Resources can be made available with some pressure, and only move from higher
   to lower pressure buildings.  For storage units, pressure = % full
 - Buildings can also require 'labor' - workers give labor in exchange for
   pay and/or satisfaction (depending on type of labor and what worker likes
   to do)
 - To reduce simulation overhead, pull resources in larger chunks less often

Simulated workers
 - wander around, help build and operate machines
 - have different moods and personalities

Networking
 - Can send messages directly to another unit (referencing that unit's ID)
   as long as they are within a certain range
 - Broadcast messages (to all units with a certain range) could be an
   alternative method

Grid-based?
 - Buildings 'take up' a single quadtree node
 - Quadtrees for area variables - air freshness, etc
 - Workers are at a specific tile and occasionally move
