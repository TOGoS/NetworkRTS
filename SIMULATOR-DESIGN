Thoughts on designing reusable components for world simulators.

Worlds
 - a 'physical world' in which agents live
 - agents bodies are part of the world
 - agent minds are simulated separately (it's sort of dualistic)

  Graph World
   - does not model geographic location
   - provides point-to-point connections between simulated objects

  Spatial World
   - simulated objects have coordinates within the world
   - some objects can move themselves by walking or thrusting
  
  Object state
   - Some object properties, such as color and position, can be defined
     in terms of functions of time.  This way the state can be updated less
     often when current values can be found by applying a function set in
     the past.  This also allows animation to be smoother in case the renderer
     redraws faster than it gets updates from the simulator.
  
  Events:
    Region content change
     - Some region of space (possibly defined relative to the position of some object)
       had objects inside it change their position (or position function)
    
    Object state change
    
    Wave
     - Data signals or destructive shockwaves that travel outward
       from a point and become weaker with distance
      Attributes:
       - Origination time
       - Speed
       - Data content (if any)
       - Destructive power (if any)
       - Destruction type (shock / heat / etc)
      Guided wave
       - Can model transmission along a wire or other line
        Attributes (in addition to general wave ones):
         - line and source endpoint
      Point-source wave
        Additional attributes:
         - Origination point, velocity
         - Edge and inner color (for use by renderers)
         - Strength at d = 1
         - Strength at which it can be ignored by the simulator

Simulator
 - May night to be tightly coupled with worlds?  Not sure.
 - Schedules events or somethings

Agent
 - 'Mind' of an object, a.k.a. 'behavior' object
 - Only interaction with simulator is through an 'shell' interface which allows an agent to:
   - [attempt to] control its own 'body'
   - send network messages
   - set timers
 - Cannot control own health/destruction unless shell provides a self-destruct method
 - Simulator calls event handlers on agent
 - An 'object' may contain multiple agents (e.g. to represent different components), but
   each agent still gets its own (conceptual) shell

  Simulated
   - Reactive; all action is done in event handlers
   - Shell is provided per-event and will NOT be used after event handler returns
  External
   - Could be a player or another program
   - May do computations in parallel with the simulation or interact with external objects
   - Shell provided must be able to accept action requests at any time, from any thread

Entity
 - An object in the world with an 'identity'
 - Simulator must keep identity <-> object link up-to-date as object state changes 
 - Only really needed for 'magical' objects that can be manipulated from
   outside the simulation, e.g. by the user or back-doors.

Reusability
 - Should define standard interfaces for agent event handling and actions
   - Simulator may provide extended interface, which agent can check for at run-time

  Common agent shell use cases:
    Movement
     - Move in some direction
     - Accellerate in some direction
     - Set engine power
    Weapons (should allow multiple weapons; think of TA battleships)
     - Aim turret
     - Fire weapon
    Networking
     - Send packet on interface
    Get host state
     (more realistically but more costly to the simulator, this could be
     accomplished by sending events when these things change)
     - Health
     - Armor strength
     - Fuel or battery level / capacity
    Get world state
     (also probably more efficient than push-based system)
     - What do the eyes see?

User interface
 - Can be implemented as an agent in a simulated object

Simulated events vs state
 - For ultra consistent realism, simulator does all sound, light calculations
 - More realistically a hybrid approach would be used, where the user interface
   models some world state internally and does its own sound/video calculations
   using e.g. OpenGL, OpenAL

Entity tracking
 - In a simulation with immutable entities, if outside processes do not need direct
   access to entity internals, entities do not need identifiers.
 - You can still simulate without global ticks by keeping 'next event timestamp'
   on nodes of the tree containing entities.
 - But this means entities must be *entirely* self contained, with no magic back doors!


Time advancement approaches
 - Sloppy: Time is not advanced uniformly.  Every agent in the game in effect runs
   in its own thread and modifies the world as it sees fit.
    - Seems to imply mutable world objects
    - The user and any physics engine(s) are simply additional agents
   
 - Atomic: World time advances atomically.  Events occur in a well-defined order.
   If events are scheduled using timestamps, the order in which events that share
   identical timestamps are processed must be well-defined.
   
   - Fixed update interval
     - Every object in the world is updated every N milliseconds; there may be
       optimizations to skip updating dormant objects
   - Variable update interval
     - Events occur at specific moments in time, and no calculations need to be
       done between events
     - To accommodate externally-triggered events, it must be possible to preempt
       planned events (something like externalEventQueue.wait( timeToNextPlannedEvent )
       accomplishes this nicely)
     - U-loop approach:
       - event loop pulls events from a queue; preempting logic is in the queue class.
       - simple event loop
       - implementation of timed event queue is a little hard to understand
       - maybe a little simpler than gensim5 if simulation is based on an event queue anyway
     - I-loop approach:
       - event loop tells simulation to update itself when needed and waits for
         external events from a separate real-time event source.
       - simple event loop
       - simulation's can manage internal events in whatever way it chooses
       - must add events differently from within the simulation thread (execute directly or add to internal queue)
         and from other threads (post to real time event source, even to add a timer to the simulator)

Entity event handling
  Functional approach:
    All events (incoming and between entities) go through simulator event loop.
    Simulator updates entities, so it knows which have been updated.

  Callback approach:
    Incoming events go through simulator event loop (to ensure proper timing).
    Inter-entity events may update entities directly, but they must then
    inform the simulation that they have been updated
    (e.g. in case their 'next auto-update time' has changed).

An approach to immutable object updating:
An object can be asked to update itself at any point during the simulation.
What this means is it will be removed by the simulator, but has an opportunity to replace itself.
It can also add other objects while it's doing this.
This can be in response to an event (triggered by a collision in the simulator or an external input),
or a timer that the object has asked to receive by adding itself with a nextUpdateTime.
The simulator can skip tree nodes representing parts of the world with late nextUpdateTimes, only
updating (removing + possibly re-adding) currently active objects.
