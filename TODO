Game19 to-do list.
i.e. things to work on when you get sick of working on some other component

Make content creation possible/fun
- quadtree editor
- simple (probably JSON-based) tile format

Ladders!

Pickups
- Model as NonTile#pickupProperties that give mass, awkardness, content
- Whether a character immediately consumes a pickup or not is up to the character
- Pickups may receive a 'PICKED_UP' message when they are picked up, giving
  them an opportunity to transform themselves
  - e.g. a time bomb may start a timer when picked up
Fuel, suit repair kit pickups

Client-server networking

Android client
- Should probably flesh out client-server protocol
  and refactor image classes to give room for animations
  before taking this on

Continuous movement entities
- Separate
  - Fast (bullet) entities
  * Normal dynamic entities
  - Static (not requiring continuous update) entities
  * Quadtree for solids

Image compositor
- Diffuse
- Radiant (office lights, stars, lit displays)
- left-right and top-bottom normal maps
These may be compiled to simple images assuming standard conditions.

Remember to allow for animations
- Discrete (bunch of frames)
  - flag to indicate interpolation desired or not
- Continuous (vector-based, like flash cartoons; would be useful for e.g. waving trees, spinning fans)
- Would need to combine many animations into one in a scalable way
  for drawing large composite nodes (e.g. distant background planes)
