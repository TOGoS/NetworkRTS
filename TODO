Make content creation possible/fun
- quadtree editor
- simple (probably JSON-based) tile format

Image compositor
- Diffuse
- Radiant (office lights, stars, lit displays)
- left-right and top-bottom normal maps
These may be compiled to simple images assuming standard conditions.


Remember to allow for animations
- Discrete
- Continuous (vector-based, like flash cartoons; would be useful for e.g. waving trees, spinning fans)
- Would need to combine many animations into one in a scalable way
  for drawing large composite nodes (e.g. distant background planes)
