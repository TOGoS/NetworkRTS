Guidelines for interpreting JSON structures as RDF.

Rationale:
- JSON is much easier to deal with than RDF and RDF encodings
  and should be sufficient for most data structures.
- It may be useful to be able to convert these data structures to RDF
  or think of them as following the RDF data model

Limitations:
- Full names of predicates are not given explicitly; there must be an
  implied mapping of short->long name
- Each subject can only have one object per predicate

Optimizations:
- class names may be given by only the last part of their URI
- classes may be omitted entirely when the object's context implies a specific class

Encode predicate -> reference mappings by appending 'Ref' to the predicate name.
e.g.

  <someProperty rdf:resource="http://foo/bar"/>

would be encoded as:

  "somePropertyRef": "http://foo/bar"

BIG FAT UPDATE (2016-01-08):
There's an RFC on an alternate way to do this,
which is used by Swagger:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03

The Swagger spec seems somewhat reasonable, so those guys might not be completely dumb.

Encode object types via a classRef predicate, e.g.

  {
    "classRef": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
    "firstName": "Jim",
    "lastName": "Beam"
  }

Or, using "$ref"...

  {
    "class": { "$ref": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person" },
    "firstName": "Jim",
    "lastName": "Beam"
  }
